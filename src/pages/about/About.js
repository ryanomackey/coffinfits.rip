            Formed by Chris Turpen as a solo project in 2015, several albums
            were released before he realized it would be way more fun with
            friends involved.

            Once Lindsay Reyna and Patrick Friend relocated to from Atlanta to
            Austin and Colorado transplant Ryan Mackey joined the band, The
            Coffin Fits were properly born.
